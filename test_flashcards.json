    {
      "front": "What is the definition of 'work' in the context of program optimization?",
      "back": "Work is the sum total of all operations executed by a program on a given input. It represents the computational effort required to complete a task."
    },
    {
      "front": "How can algorithm design significantly reduce work? Provide an example.",
      "back": "Choosing a more efficient algorithm reduces work, e.g., replacing an O(n\u00b2) bubble sort with an O(n log n) merge sort eliminates redundant comparisons, drastically cutting total operations."
    },
    {
      "front": "Why might reducing work not directly translate to faster execution time?",
      "back": "Hardware factors like caching, vectorization, and instruction-level parallelism complicate the relationship between work and runtime. Fewer operations don't guarantee better hardware utilization."
    },
    {
      "front": "What distinguishes the new Bentley rules from the original ones?",
      "back": "The new rules focus solely on optimizing work (algorithmic and structural improvements), whereas original rules addressed outdated hardware-specific optimizations from decades ago."
    },
    {
      "front": "Explain the concept of 'packing' in data structures.",
      "back": "Packing stores multiple data elements within a single machine word (e.g., encoding a date's year, month, day in 22 bits). This reduces memory usage and movement but may increase access computation."
    },
    {
      "front": "What trade-off occurs when using packed data representations?",
      "back": "Packing saves space and reduces memory operations but requires additional computation to decode individual fields (e.g., extracting a month from a packed date)."
    },
    {
      "front": "How does precomputation reduce work?",
      "back": "Precomputing values once and reusing them avoids redundant calculations. For example, pre-encoding dates saves repeated string parsing operations during manipulation."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is 'loop hoisting' and its purpose?",
      "back": "Loop hoisting moves loop-invariant computations (those unchanged per iteration) outside the loop, reducing redundant operations each iteration."
    },
    {
      "front": "How does inlining functions reduce work?",
      "back": "Inlining replaces function calls with the function's body, eliminating call/return overhead and parameter passing, thereby decreasing total operations."
    },
    {
      "front": "Why is sparsity an important consideration in data structures?",
      "back": "Sparse data (e.g., mostly zero matrices) can be stored more efficiently using structures like bit vectors or hash tables, reducing memory access and computation for empty elements."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the principle behind 'lazy evaluation'?",
      "back": "Lazy evaluation delays computation until the result is explicitly needed, avoiding unnecessary operations for values that may never be used."
    },
    {
      "front": "Explain 'common-subexpression elimination'.",
      "back": "This optimization identifies repeated calculations (e.g., computing a + b in multiple places) and stores the result, eliminating redundant computations."
    },
    {
      "front": "How does caching contribute to reducing work?",
      "back": "Caching stores the results of expensive operations (e.g., complex calculations) so subsequent requests can reuse cached results instead of recomputing."
    },
    {
      "front": "Why is short-circuiting used in conditional expressions?",
      "back": "Short-circuiting evaluates conditions from left to right. If the first condition in an AND (&&) is false, the second is skipped, avoiding unnecessary evaluations."
    },
    {
      "front": "How do sentinel values reduce work in loops?",
      "back": "Sentinels (e.g., a dummy element added to a data structure) eliminate boundary checks by allowing loops to run without conditional breaks for the end condition."
